# Ballistic Blobs

This is a game we've made for a Challenge at the Apple Developer Academy. We wanted to make something original and I think we did just that. A game where you tap rapidly moving balls, as they dash in and out of the lens of an occluded screen. Keep up with the change of instructions and pace as the clock ticks down.
